# BehaviourCoder

This software is a visual behaviour coder that allows researchers, consultants or educators to observe and analize behaviour from pre-recorded videos.

[Here is an example](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/18/science/more-evidence-birds-can-count.html) of one type of project where this software could be useful. 

Other potential use cases could be observing students in the classroom and recording their behaviour.

This software is licensed under the LGPL.
