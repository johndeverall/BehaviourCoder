This behaviour coder software was developed in order to enable easy analysis of behavioural video data in human and non human subjects.

This software is designed for ease of use, to minimize the amount of training a person requires to use the software.

## Behaviour Coder Features

#### 1) A generic location panel

This is where location designation buttons can be created to record for a subject;
* A count of location transitions.
* When transitions happen in the chronology of a trial.
* What transitions occurred (i.e. from location A to location D).

Location buttons can created, placed and sized anywhere within the location panel.

#### 2) Configurable, pre-setting of analysis duration.

* An analysis can be set to run for a pre-defined length of time.

#### 3) Saving of analysis results and analysis configuration to Microsoft excel.

* This allows not only data but also analysis configuration / experiment setup to be saved and loaded again for later use, or shared with other researchers.

#### 4) Integrated video

* Further installation of video libraries (for example VLC) is not required.

#### 5) Clickable behaviour timers (with selectable colours) with configurable key assignment.

* Behaviour timers can be clicked with the mouse and in addition a key can be chosen assigned to each behaviour timer.

#### 6) Clickable event counters (with selectable colours) with configurable key assignment.

* Event counters can be clicked with the mouse and in addition a key can be chosen and assigned to each event counter.

#### 7) Additional custom analysis fields and validation.

* Additional fields can be added to any analysis, for example subject id, session number, mirror included etc.
* Validation can be applied so that only valid subject ids can be entered (for example).
