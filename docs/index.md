Welcome to the simple behaviour coder. This software is a visual behaviour coder, a type of video analyzer that allows researchers, consultants or educators to observe and analyze behaviour from
pre-recorded videos.

[Here is an example](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/18/science/more-evidence-birds-can-count.html) of the type of project where this software has been useful.

Other potential use cases could be observing students in the classroom and recording their behaviour for learning assessments, or analysing videos of football
matches to collect handover and possession statistics for coaching purposes.

This software was created by John Deverall and Dr Alexis Garland with the support of Ruhr University Bochum.

This software is licensed under the GPL.

The source code is available [here](https://www.github.com/johndeverall/behaviourcoder).

Issues and feature requests can be logged [here](https://www.github.com/johndeverall/behaviourcoder/issues).

Should you have interest in helping to develop this project further, please contact John Deverall at johndeverall@gmail.com or Dr Alexis Garland at dralexisgarland@gmail.com.
