Welcome to the Simple Behaviour Coder. This software is a visual behaviour coder, a type of video analyzer that allows researchers, consultants or educators to observe and analyze behaviour from
pre-recorded videos.

Below is an example of the type of project where this software has been useful.
<br/><br/>

<iframe title="New York Times Video - Embed Player" width="480" height="321" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" id="nyt_video_player" src="https://static01.nyt.com/video/players/offsite/index.html?videoId=100000003235873"></iframe>

Other potential use cases could be observing students in the classroom and recording their behaviour for learning assessments, or analysing videos of football
matches to collect handover and possession statistics for coaching purposes.
